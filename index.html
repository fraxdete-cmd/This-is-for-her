        I don’t even know if you’ll ever read this.<br><br>

        But if you do, I just want you to know,
        I still think about you sometimes.<br><br>

        We both tried. We both cared.
        But the universe just never gave us enough
        space to become “us.”<br><br>

        I just wonder… if we had met at a different
        point in life, would the ending have been different?<br><br>

        Anyway, I hope you’re doing okay,
        even though we’re not in each other’s lives anymore.
