bff, it’s already a new year.

I just wish you well,
and I hope you stay happy—always.

Never forget that I care for you.
Never forget that I’m always here for you.
I’ve got your back, no matter what.

We both cared, and we both tried
in the best way we knew how.
But the universe never gave us
enough space to become “us.”
Still, I’m grateful for every moment we shared.

I hope you never change.
Stay the way you are,
because you’re more beautiful
than you think you are.

You were, and you will always be,
one of the most beautiful things
that ever happened to me.
